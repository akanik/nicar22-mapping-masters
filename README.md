# Mapping For Analysis And Online Display
Docs and data for the NICAR22 hands-on class: Mapping For Analysis And Online Display

Friday, March 4, 9 am - 12 pm ET

Instructors: Allie Kanik, Houston Chronicle

If you work with data in a newsroom, sooner or later you will need to analyze geographic data and use the results display in a map.

Join us for this half-day session where we’ll cover intermediate mapping skills with QGIS and Mapbox. During this session, you’ll learn key analysis and visualizations techniques by beginning an investigation into how Atlanta’s housing market has been effected by COVID.

We’ll cover tools, workflows and best practices to help you transform public data into compelling maps and narratives that you can reuse on your own markets. This workshop will specifically address:

- Calculating points in polygon
- Creating hexbins
- Using QGIS for visual analysis
- Exporting geographic data for interactive display
- Importing geographic data into Mapbox
- Mapbox Studio: Styling by data and UI
- Mapbox iframes, and their limitations
- Intro to mapboxgl (including example code)

Workshop prerequisites: 

- Participants should have some familiarity with QGIS to get the most out of this class. If you have never used QGIS, reviewing [these introductory documents](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LOK5Ui_dMzAito3WRZAXhG6K8vjUabxf?usp=sharing) will be helpful.
- Participants should also have already signed up for a [free Mapbox account](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signin/?route-to=%22https://account.mapbox.com/%22).
